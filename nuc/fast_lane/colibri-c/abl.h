/* ============================================================================
 * abl.h — per-item EXPERT CAUSAL-ABLATION config for colibri's moe().
 *
 * A research instrument, off the hot path: OFF by default, byte-identical to
 * upstream unless a run explicitly enables it via ABLATE_SCORE=<manifest>.
 *
 * PURPOSE.  Let a named set of (layer, expert) cells be ablated for ONE
 * teacher-forced item, in one of three modes, so the causal effect of an expert
 * on the FINAL logits can be measured against the same item's baseline. This is
 * the causal complement to the routing-affinity Expert Atlas (#175): the Atlas
 * shows what routes WHERE; ablation shows what an expert actually DOES.
 *
 *   mode 0  OFF             — no ablation; the forward is byte-identical to the
 *                             un-ablated build (every abl_*() below is inert).
 *   mode 1  CONTRIBUTION    — routing is UNCHANGED (the expert is still selected,
 *                             counted, and traced); only its weighted output
 *                             contribution to the MoE block is replaced with 0.
 *                             Isolates "what does this expert's output add,
 *                             holding the gate fixed". (CPU forward path.)
 *   mode 2  ROUTE-AROUND    — the cell is dropped from the token's selected set
 *                             BEFORE the routed weights are renormalised, so the
 *                             remaining kept experts absorb the mass (norm_topk
 *                             over the survivors).  Isolates "can the model cope
 *                             without this expert by reweighting the others".
 *                             This is the arm that mirrors EXPERT_BUDGET-style
 *                             dropping, per token, on a chosen expert.
 *   mode 3  MODULE-SWAP     — the cell's routing slot is remapped to a substitute
 *                             expert (swap_to) keeping the original routed weight,
 *                             i.e. a different learned module stands in.  A cheap
 *                             deterministic-replaceability probe.
 *
 * The three moe() hooks (route-around compaction + module-swap remap in FASE A;
 * contribution skip in the FASE C CPU accumulate) are ALL guarded by g_abl.mode,
 * so when mode==0 none fires and output stays identical to the un-ablated build.
 * Modes 2/3 edit the SELECTED set before the eusage/eheat/elast counters and the
 * norm_topk/routed_scale/ROUTE_TRACE emit, so all downstream accounting reflects
 * the post-ablation routing.
 *
 * PER-ITEM RESET (the anti-leak invariant).  The ABLATE_SCORE driver calls
 * abl_reset() then abl_set_item() for each item, so an item's ablation spec can
 * never leak into the next item.  This header holds no cross-item state and has
 * no Model/Cfg dependency, so the decision logic unit-tests against the SAME
 * source the engine links (tests/test_ablate.c).
